# Hi jenin
you may realise instead of waking up at 6am 2h before I leave for my flight its 23:52, oh what one can do for an orpheus plushie sob
## That is it
Yes that is really it
# So seriously now
This whole holiday so far I have been doing haxmas, I am actually in awe of how good this ysws is, the reward is good and the workshops are AWESOME even if they are awfully late :P This format of new thing everyday has really gotten me more into other languages I EVEN started learning svelte cause of this, and made a logo for my (website)[https://thefrog.me/] It also made me appreciate more niche ysws. I did not do fusering, why? because i thought it sucked. But now that I had no choice but to do certain things, I actually did the things and it really showed me how much I missed out on and that I should do small easy ysws. From the top/bottom/left/right/front/back, thank you so much for this awesome experience. Next year too please!<img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T09V59WQY1E/sillybleh/dfbca0754607785d.png" alt="sillybleh" width="64" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle'}} />
